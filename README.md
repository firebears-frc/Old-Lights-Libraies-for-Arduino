# Old-Lights-Libraies-for-Arduino
These are the libraries that are necessary to run some of the older lights code. 
These Libraries are no longer available online or in libraries manager. 
You will need to MANUALLY add these to the libraries folder in Arduino. 
For Windows: 
  open File explorer, click on Libraries on the side menu -> Documents -> Arduino -> Libraries.
  Then, create a folder with the exact same name as the .h and/or .ccp file. drag the files in and you are good to go. 
Mac: 
  Open Finder, Select Documents -> Arduino -> Libraries. 
  Then, create a folder with the exact same name as the .h and/or .ccp file. drag the files in and you are good to go!
